# Chess
Base classes needed to create Chess have been provided for me. I added my logger from the previous assignment to help me test and debug. I worked on Windows.

## FEN String Support
To set up the board with a given FEN string, I iterated through the string, placing pieces according to their respective characters, moving ranks whenever I encounter the "/" character, and moving file whenever I encounted a number (by however many it says). For the white pieces to appear on the correct side, I had to begin at row 7 and move down a row (up the board) each "/" character.

## Implementing King, Knight, and Pawn Movement
I used the provided Bitboard.h class, which has a helpful template iterator. When the game starts, I generate all possible moves for kings and knights from any position on the board and store those bitboards for later. I later add the relevant moves to a vector of possible moves with the functions generateKingMoves() and generateKnightMoves(). I could not do the same thing for pawns, since they have multiple different kinds of moves, so I generate those by hand using bitboards containing enemies and empty spaces. Single moves forward are calculated, for example, by shifting each pawn bit by 8 or -8 (depending on whether it's white or black and must move up or down the board). Then, I & the bitboard of empty spaces to make sure that only single moves into an open space are added. Double moves forward are calculated by taking these single moves and, if they fall in either rank ahead of the starting ranks, I shift the pawn bit another 8 or -8. For captures, I calculate left captures and right captures separately, using masks for the left and right sides of the board to make sure pawns cannot capture around the edges. Additionally, I had to modify the way that piece notation was found to rely on the bit's owner so that my state string was correct. I also had to modify how ChessSquare determines whether pieces are capturable by comparing the owners rather than xor-ing the gameTag.
